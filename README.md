# cognitive biases

I love cognitive biases. I was inspired by Rolf Dobelli's book [The Art of Thinking Clearly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Thinking_Clearly).

There is a great list of biases on Wikipedia: [List of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).

Here are some random notes about biases which I noticed.

## Sense of taste bias

## Speaking fast feels more productive than writing slowly.

Imagine you are in a video conference with roughly seven people. People talk fast to get the message out, and
then you want all participants to watch your shared screen.

You want everybody to agree on a definition of a term.

Grrrrr. At least for me this picture provides some kind of pain.

Everybody wants to be important. Everybody wants to say something.

And you want them to shut up (or at least slow down)? 

(joking) That's offensive, that's disrespectful!

Speaking fast feels more productive/important than writing slowly. ... live would be boring without homo sapiens and heir biases.
